## Research question 1 (census tract level): ​Which census tracts have the most serious eviction problem? Does the distribution relate to urban capital?​
### Research plan
- Measure and map the urban capital available by census tract within the city (with a focus on those tracts with the highest eviction rates)

### To-do
- find the census tract eviction rate data
- create dash board of urban capital metrics
- find the correlation between eviction rate data and capital metrics

## Research question 2 (city level): Why is the eviction rate so high in Richmond city?
### Research plan
- Step1: Find cities with similar demographic factors, like population, median income, etc.​
- Step2: compare other factors of interest, such as city-level policies between Richmond and similar cities​

### To-do
- find policy data on city and state level
- integrate data sources
- try linear regression with quantified policies
- apply machine learning algorithms to do clustering on city level
